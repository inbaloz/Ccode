*lambda2 was changed to the one in hydrocarbons.

*f(4,5) was changed to calculate also the atomj f(4,5).

*in equation Eover D_sigma was taken out, as in the article for silicon oxide.

*in E_val F8 was 0.0 if it not a B or N atom, changed to 1.0;

*in Etors there was a -1 which is supposed to be -3.

*In E_over and Eunder I removed the if (delta >/< 0) term.

*in n_lp I multiplied delta_e by -1.
